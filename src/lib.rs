//! Fast access to a thread-identifying value, [`ThrId`]. See its documentation
//! for details, as there are some caveats compared to [`std::thread::ThreadId`].
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! The entry-point to this library is [`ThrId::get`].
//!
//! ```
//! let main_thread_id = thrid::ThrId::get();
//! let other_thread_id = std::thread::spawn(|| thrid::ThrId::get()).join().unwrap();
//!
//! assert_ne!(main_thread_id, other_thread_id);
//! ```

/// A value that uniquely identifies a running thread.
///
/// This returns a thread-specific value that is not shared among any currently
/// running threads.
///
/// Typically, it will be a pointer to some low level thread-specific data
/// structure, such as the thread control block, but on some platforms it may be
/// implemented in a number of other ways.
///
/// # Caveats
///
/// There are a few caveats. The TL;DR is that the OS may recycle these values
/// (similar to system thread IDs), and the internal impl is subject to change.
///
/// - Similar to OS thread IDs (but unlike Rust's `std::thread::ThreadId`),
///   these may be reused by a new thread if some another thread terminates.
///   Concretely, if `tid0` and `tid1` are [`ThrId`]s from two different calls
///   to [`ThrId::get`], then:
///      - `tid0 != tid1` will be true if they are from different threads.
///
///      - `tid0 == tid1` will be true if *either* they are from the same
///        thread, or they are two unrelated threads which have never been alive
///        at the same time (this means that at least one of them is from a
///        thread which is no longer running).
///
/// - ThrId values only have meaning locally within a process. They are
///   meaningless in cross-process contexts.
///
/// - The internal implementation of [`ThrId::get()`] is subject to change, do
///   not rely on an `ThrId`'s value having any external meaning (you may want
///   to use the `thread-id` crate if you need this).
///
///     For example, while `ThrId` values may happen to hold the same value as
///     returned by `pthread_self()` or `GetCurrentThreadId()` value on certain
///     targets (ones where a more efficient implementaion is not yet
///     available), this must not be relied upon -- it is entirely subject to
///     change.
///
/// - As such, is generally wrong to compare values of `thrid::ThrId` from two
///   different versions of this crate. Part of the reason that theÂ [`ThrId`]
///   wrapper exists is to help enforce that.
